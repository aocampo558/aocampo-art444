    <h2>Fall '22</h2>
    <p> This was my first semester at SDSU! I didn’t know what to expect. I was nervous, excited, and curious as to what my classes were going to look like at a university. I was really happy to start a new life and unfold a new chapter! This work is a lot of my beginner work, and it’s very noticible. This was a year of figuring out how to make art on a computer. I had taken a ceramics class, a typography class where we made a book for ‘Skolos and Wedell’, and I also did some denim painting on the side! </p>

  <p>During this semester, I started to become more familiar with I started getting familiar with adobe. I started to learn more about typography which I remember really enjoying! I started to experiment more and learn more about image trace. Here, I started to create a lot of my own personal projects. I started to get more in touch with my style.</p>

    <h2>Fall '23</h2>
    <p>The semester fall 2023 started to get a bit harder for me. I started to take level two classes which required more time and planning and proficiency in Adobe. I had lots of cool projects due such as a font look book that I had to print out, as well as a few posters and books from my graphic design II class. </p>

    <h2>Spring '24</h2>
    <p>This was the semester that I did not like doing graphic design. I call this my “rebel semester” because during this time, I took all dance classes. I had always wanted to become a dancer but never believed it was possible, and I was so fed up with sitting at the screen all day and I decided to take a risk and go for it. This was my quarter life crisis semester! This was the starting point  to a lot of soul searching. I was having a blast, but was completely lost! </p>

    <h2>Gap Fall '24</h2>
    <p>Fall 2024 was full of changes in my life and career, and so I thought it would be best to take a break from school and do a little soul searching. In this time, I was experimenting with different career paths such as dance, fitness, nutrition, and or course, art. I found myself experimenting in the hip hop culture and was inspired by Grafitti art. Below is a showcase of what I was creating during this time.</p>

  <div class="headline">
      <h2>Gap Spring '25</h2>
      <p>During this time, I was still trying to figure out what path I could take my graphic design skills, so I decided to experiment (even more)! I had shifted from graffiti art to more typography based art and started to make  my own shirt designs. I printed a few of them out and really enjoyed how they turned out. I gained a lot of experience doing this by learning how to go about designing a shirt which is great if I ever wanted to start a clothing line. During this time, I had also worked on some freelance work for a house club! The event was called “Sacred Medicine”... This was a creative (and experimental) few months.</p>
